## 🎯 What You Get

Each participant gets their own isolated environment:

### Your Personal Resources
```
Participant: john_doe
├── Unity Catalog: mcp_workshop_john_doe
│   └── Schema: default
│       ├── products (sample data)
│       ├── customers (sample data)
│       └── sales (sample data)

### Resource Naming Convention
- **Prefix**: Your username (cleaned: lowercase, underscores only)
- **Catalog**: `mcp_workshop_{your_prefix}`
- **MCP Server App**: `databricks-mcp-{your_prefix}`

## 🔧 Setup Process

The setup script walks you through:

1. **👤 Identity Setup**: Choose your workshop username
2. **🔐 Authentication**: Configure Databricks access (PAT or profile)
3. **⚙️ Resource Creation**: Deploy your personal environment
4. **🚀 Application Setup**: Configure local development
5. **🎉 Ready to Learn**: Start the workshop!

## 📁 Generated Files

After setup, you'll have:
- `.env.local` - Your workshop configuration
- `databricks.{prefix}.yml` - Your personal DABS config
- `frontend/.env.local` - Frontend configuration

## 🎮 Using Your Workshop

### Start Local Development
```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
# Visit: http://localhost:3000
```

### Access Your MCP Server App
Check the Databricks Apps page for: `databricks-mcp-{your_prefix}`

### Workshop Sections
1. **Managed MCP** - Use built-in Unity Catalog functions
2. **External MCP** - Connect to external MCP servers
3. **Custom MCP** - Build your own MCP server
4. **Local IDE** - Integrate with development tools

## 🧹 Cleanup (For Instructors)

### List All Participants
```bash
./cleanup_workshop.sh --list
```

### Clean Up Specific Participant
```bash
./cleanup_workshop.sh --participant john_doe
```

### Clean Up All Resources (⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE)
```bash
./cleanup_workshop.sh --all
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Authentication Issues
```bash
# Refresh your Databricks token
databricks auth login

# Test connection
databricks current-user me
```

### Resource Creation Failed
```bash
# Check DABS status
databricks bundle validate -t dev

# Re-run resource setup
databricks bundle run setup_resources -t dev
```

### Frontend Issues
```bash
# Reinstall dependencies
cd frontend
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### Permission Issues
- Make sure you have `CREATE CATALOG` permissions in Databricks
- Some organizations require admin approval for new catalogs
- Contact your Databricks admin if needed

## 💡 Tips for Success

### For Participants
- Use a simple, unique username (your first name or initials work great)
- Keep your PAT secure and don't share it
- If something breaks, just run `./setup.sh` again - it's safe to re-run
- Ask for help early and often!

### For Instructors
- Test the setup in your workspace before the workshop
- Have backup PATs ready for participants who need help
- Use `./cleanup_workshop.sh --list` to monitor participant progress
- Consider pre-creating some resources for large workshops
